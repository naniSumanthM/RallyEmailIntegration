# RallyEmailIntegration
https://rally1.rallydev.com/slm/login.op

Rally Agile is a scrum tool developed by CA agile. It helps create user stories and tracks various agile metrics.
Small firms maintain email accounts to support user queries for key enterprise systems.
I have written a custom .NET integration that automates the process of creating user stories, and assigning them to the respective developers.
I found that there is excess communication via Slack amongst team members to determine who is working on what. To eliminate this I have
developed a notification service that communicates the newly created user stories and the assigned developer for that ticket.
